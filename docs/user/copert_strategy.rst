CopertStrategy
==============

The CopertStrategy implements emission calculation for hot and (optionally) cold emissions focusing on
calculation with the Copert methodology.

.. note::

    The possible configurations for this Strategy can become quite complex. Please have a look at the
    example config files ``copert_config.yaml``, ``copert_hot_config.yaml``,
    ``copert_cold_config.yaml``, and ``copert_hot_fixed_speed_config.yaml`` in the folder
    ``example/example_configs/``. They contain example configurations
    for the ``CopertStrategy`` and may help you to understand how the ``CopertStrategy`` can be used.

hot emissions
-------------
The Copert methodology for hot emissions is used to calculate hot emissions. By default the ``CopertHotStrategy``
is used to calculate hot emissions.
If the config argument ``fixed_speed`` is set to True, the ``CopertHotFixedSpeedStrategy`` is used to
calculate hot emissions using fixed speeds instead.

cold emissions
--------------
By default the ``CopertColdStrategy`` is used to calculate cold emissions. In the config file the argument
``cold_strategy`` may be used to specify the path to a different Strategy. If a ``cold_strategy`` is
given in the config file it will be used instead of the ``CopertColdStrategy``. Note that cold emissions are only
calculated if the config argument ``only_hot`` is not set to True.

A note on the data loading process
----------------------------------

The conversion of berlin_format data to yeti_format data in conducted independently for the hot
and the cold Strategies. This is done to keep the dependencies between the hot and cold Strategies
to a minimum. It enables the ``CopertStrategy`` to work with any cold Strategy you want.

The consequence is that some computations may be done twice, because they are done by both
the hot and the cold ``load_berlin_format_data_function``s. The constructed yeti_format files
will be in two subfolders of the output folder (the output folder is specified in the config file).

Data Requirements
-----------------
What data is required for the CopertStrategy depends on the config arguments. There are several cases:

1. ``only_hot`` is set to ``yes`` in the config file.
    1. ``fixed_speed`` is set to ``yes`` in the config file. Then the Data Requirements are the same as for the
       :doc:`CopertHotFixedSpeedStrategy <copert_hot_strategy_fixed_speed>`.
    2. ``fixed_speed`` is set to ``no`` or not given in the config file. Then the DataRequirements are the
       same as for the :doc:`CopertHotStrategy <copert_hot_strategy>`.

2. ``only_hot`` is set to ``no`` or not given in the config file.
    1. The argument ``cold_strategy`` is given in the config file. Then the Data Requirements are the same as for the given
       ``cold_strategy`` and the ``CopertHotStrategy`` (or ``CopertHotFixedSpeedStrategy``
       depending on the config argument ``fixed_speed``).
    2. The argument ``cold_strategy`` is not given in the config file. Then the Data Requirements are the same as for the
       :doc:`CopertColdStrategy <copert_cold_strategy>` and the ``CopertHotStrategy`` (or ``CopertHotFixedSpeedStrategy``
       depending on the config argument ``fixed_speed``).

What to put in the config.yaml
------------------------------
If you want to use the ``CopertStrategy`` for your calculations, you need to set the following options
in your config.yaml. Donâ€™t forget to add the parameters specified here: :doc:`Configuring YETI <config>`

If using mode ``berlin_format``:
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

.. code-block:: yaml

    mode:                             berlin_format
    strategy:                         code.copert_strategy.CopertStrategy.CopertStrategy
    load_berlin_format_data_function: code.copert_strategy.load_berlin_format_data.load_copert_berlin_format_data
    load_yeti_format_data_function:   code.copert_strategy.load_yeti_format_data.load_copert_yeti_format_data

    only_hot:           no  # or yes. Default is no
    fixed_speed:        no  # or yes. Default is no

    [..]  # add the file locations for the data required by the CopertHotStrategy (or CopertHotFixedSpeedStrategy depending on fixed_speed)
    [..]  # add any additional args that you want to pass to the CopertHotStrategy (or CopertHotFixedSpeedStrategy depending on fixed_speed)

    # if only_hot is yes, the following arguments may be omitted.
    cold_strategy:                         path.to.ColdStrategy
    cold_load_berlin_format_data_function: path.to.load_berlin_format_data_function.for.cold_strategy
    cold_load_yeti_format_data_function:   path.to.load_yeti_format_data_function.for.cold_strategy

    [..]  # add the file locations of any additional files needed for the cold_strategy
    [..]  # add any additional args that you want to pass to the cold_strategy


If using mode ``yeti_format``:
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

.. code-block:: yaml

    mode:                           yeti_format
    strategy:                       code.copert_strategy.CopertStrategy.CopertStrategy
    load_yeti_format_data_function: code.copert_strategy.load_yeti_format_data.load_copert_yeti_format_data

    only_hot:           no  # or yes. Default is no
    fixed_speed:        no  # or yes. Default is no

    [..]  # add the file locations for the data required by the CopertHotStrategy (or CopertHotFixedSpeedStrategy depending on fixed_speed)
    [..]  # add any additional args that you want to pass to the CopertHotStrategy (or CopertHotFixedSpeedStrategy depending on fixed_speed)


    # if only_hot is yes, the following arguments may be omitted.
    cold_strategy:                       path.to.ColdStrategy
    cold_load_yeti_format_data_function: path.to.load_yeti_format_data_function.for.cold_strategy

    [..]  # add the file locations of any additional files needed for the cold_strategy
    [..]  # add any additional args that you want to pass to the cold_strategy


How to deal with naming conflicts
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Naming conflicts between the config arguments for the hot Strategy and the arguments for the
cold Strategy are a possible issue. For example ``berlin_format_emission_factors`` is a config argument
for the ``CopertHotStrategy`` and for the ``HbefaColdStrategy``, however the two Strategies require input data
in a different format. How do we deal with this issue when we want to use the ``HbefaColdStrategy`` to
calculate cold emissions with the ``CopertStrategy``?

We solve this naming issue by prefixing the argument that should go to the hot Strategy with ``hot_[..]``.
The argument that should go to the cold Strategy is prefixed with ``cold_[..]``.

In our example for ``berlin_format_emission_factors`` we would add these lines to the config:

.. code-block:: yaml

    hot_berlin_format_emission_factors:    path/to/ef_data_for_hot_strategy.csv
    cold_berlin_format_emission_factors:   path/to/ef_data_for_cold_strategy.csv

If the two Strategies require the same config argument, there is no need to add prefixes. For example the config argument
``berlin_format_link_data`` is required for the ``CopertHotStrategy`` and the ``HbefaColdStrategy``. However both
Strategies require the exact same data. Therefore it is sufficient to specify it once:

.. code-block:: yaml

    berlin_format_link_data:               path/to/berlin_format_link_data.csv

A note on the validation_function
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
We currently don't provide a dedicated validation function for this Strategy. However in most cases you can use a
validation function for a different Strategy. Consider these cases:

1. ``only_hot`` is set to ``yes`` in the config file.
    1. ``fixed_speed`` is set to ``yes`` in the config file. You can use the validation function for the
       :doc:`CopertHotFixedSpeedStrategy <copert_hot_strategy_fixed_speed>`.
    2. ``fixed_speed`` is set to ``no`` or not given in the config file. You can use the validation function for the
       :doc:`CopertHotStrategy <copert_hot_strategy>`.

2. ``only_hot`` is set to ``no`` or not given in the config file.
    1. ``cold_strategy`` is given in the config file. In this case we don't provide a valiation function that you can use
       out of the box. If you want to use validation, you will have to
       :doc:`write your own valiation function <../developer/add_validate_function>`.
    2. ``cold_strategy`` is not given in the config file. You can use the validation function for the
       :doc:`CopertColdStrategy <copert_cold_strategy>`.


Output
------
The output of this Strategy depends on the config arguments. There are three cases:

1. ``only_hot`` is set to True. Then the output is the same as for the ``CopertStrategy`` or the
   ``CopertHotFixedSpeedStrategy`` (depending on the the value of the ``fixed_speed`` config argument)
2. ``only_hot`` is not set to True and no ``cold_strategy`` is given in the config file.
   Then the output is the same as for the ``CopertColdStrategy``.
3. ``only_hot`` is not set to True and a ``cold_strategy`` is given in the config file.
   Then the output consists of the files generated by the ``CopertHotStrategy`` or ``CopertHotFixedSpeedStrategy``
   (prefixed with ``hot_[..]``) and the files produced by the ``cold_strategy`` (prefixed with ``cold_[..]``).
